# Bluetooth-control-car-with-remote-arduino
In childhood many of us like to play with a remote control car but the major problem experience was from remote, but now no need of that box remote, as we can use our smart phone as an alternative  of remote, no need to carry an extra remote with your car fully controlled via Bluetooth. For Bluetooth control I have use a HC-05 Bluetooth module which is simple to use, and plug in with arduino  uno  circuit. A    motor driver has been used which acts as an interface between the control circuit and motor, code has been written and uploaded using Arduino IDE.  A mobile app which is used in this project can be downloaded from Google play store.
